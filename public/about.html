                  <p> Hi! My name is Gabriella and I am a junior at Deerfield Academy. I was inspired to start this project when I heard from my father, who is a doctor, that the morale at his hospital was extremely low. Doctors were beginning to feel hopeless as they treated many new COVID patients every day. One of the most important values learned growing up is to express gratitude for all those who help you or your community in any way. So, this project was born to thank those workers spending so much time away from their loved ones. My hope is to expand Kind Words to many more hospitals across America. I am working alongside students in Jordan, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Morocco, to make this into a global movement to express our deepest gratitude for those risking their safety for the rest of humanity. </p>
